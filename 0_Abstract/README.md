# M3_Wiper_Control_System
## ABSTRACT
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. It is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain,    snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris. Almost all motor vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and cabin watercraft as well as some aircraft have one or more of these wipers, which are usually required by law. A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached. The prior system required manual wiper activation,by changing the frequency As its results the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied . The project's goals are to improve ageing cars' systems by giving automated transmission.wiping system, to improve the system by incorporating a sensor and actuator, and to create a simple software that would completely operate with the system.the framework This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers. Despite the fact that. This system will be upgraded to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface to remove water from the windscreen.
