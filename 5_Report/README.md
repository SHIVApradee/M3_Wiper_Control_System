# M3_Wiper_Control_System
## ABSTRACT
* Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. It is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain,    snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris. Almost all motor vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and cabin watercraft as well as some aircraft have one or more of these wipers, which are usually required by law. A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached. The prior system required manual wiper activation,by changing the frequency As its results the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied . The project's goals are to improve ageing cars' systems by giving automated transmission.wiping system, to improve the system by incorporating a sensor and actuator, and to create a simple software that would completely operate with the system.the framework This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers. Despite the fact that. This system will be upgraded to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface to remove water from the windscreen.# M3_Wiper_Control_System
## INTRODUCTION
* This Wiper Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen. Because driving a vehicle in the rain is quite difficult, we will use wipers to clear the front screen of the vehicle, which is a mirror, so that we may drive the vehicle even in the rain. The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.
## WORKING PRINCIPLE
* If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again  the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.
## THE 4 W's AND H
### WHAT
* A wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with conditions.
### WHY
* Windshield wipers are a small part of your car, but they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button! The windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. 
### WHEN
* Wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver's visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles.
### WHO 
* Wiper is essentially used by the manufactrers to assemble it into the cars.
### HOW
* Wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car back and forth.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### STRENGTH
* It provides clear visibility to drive
* Operating principle is easy
* It is possipble to operate manually
### WEAKNESS
* Proper maintenance should be done
* High expenses
* Cause error while implementing
### THREATS
* Software issues
* Like any other part of a car, windshield wipers can need repair or replacement after being in service too long.
