### DESCRIPTION
The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications. It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.
## FEATURES
* In a LQFP100 package, the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM.
* On-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A on STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 (new order code)
* USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.
* Virtual Com port Debug port (with new order code only)
* Large-scale storage (with new order code only)
* Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.
* 3 V and 5 V external application power supply
## USES
* This Microcontroller is utilised in printing and scanning machines ,heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems.
* This module can be found in a variety of household products.
## THE 4 W's AND H
### WHAT
* A wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with conditions.
### WHY
* Windshield wipers are a small part of your car, but they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button! The windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. 
### WHEN
* Wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver's visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles.
### WHO 
* Wiper is essentially used by the manufactrers to assemble it into the cars.
### HOW
* Wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car back and forth.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### STRENGTH
* It provides clear visibility to drive
* Operating principle is easy
* It is possipble to operate manually
### WEAKNESS
* Proper maintenance should be done
* High expenses
* Cause error while implementing
### THREATS
* Software issues
* Like any other part of a car, windshield wipers can need repair or replacement after being in service too long.
